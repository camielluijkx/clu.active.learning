    Task Parallel Library (TPL)

    Modern processors use threads to concurrently run multiple operations. If your application performs all of its 
    logic on a single thread, you do not make the best use of the available processing resources, which can result in a 
    poor experience for your users. In this module, you will learn how to improve the performance of your applications 
    by distributing your operations across multiple threads.
    
    A typical graphical application consists of blocks of code that run when an event occurs; these events fire in 
    response to actions such as the user clicking a button, moving the mouse, or opening a window. By default, this 
    code runs by using the UI thread. However, you should avoid executing long-running operations on this thread 
    because they can cause the UI to become unresponsive. Also, running all of your code on a single thread does not 
    make good use of available processing power in the computer; most modern machines contain multiple processor cores, 
    and running all operations on a single thread will only use a single processor core. 

    The Microsoft® .NET Framework includes the Task Parallel Library. This is a set of classes that makes it easy to 
    distribute your code execution across multiple threads. You can run these threads on different processor cores and 
    take advantage of the parallelism that this model provides. You can assign long-running tasks to a separate thread, 
    leaving the UI thread free to respond to user actions.

        The Task class lies at the heart of the Task Parallel Library in the .NET Framework. As the name suggests, you 
        use the Task class to represent a task, or in other words, a unit of work. The Task class enables you to 
        perform multiple tasks concurrently, each on a different thread. Behind the scenes, the Task Parallel Library 
        manages the thread pool and assigns tasks to threads. You can implement sophisticated multitasking 
        functionality by using the Task Parallel Library to chain tasks, pause tasks, wait for tasks to complete before 
        continuing, and perform many other operations.

                an Action delegate that wraps this method.

                The .NET Framework class library contains the built-in Action delegate that lets you quickly define a 
                delegate that has no return value and up to 16 parameters that use generic parameter types. It also 
                provides the Func delegate that returns a result. You can use these delegates instead of defining new

                Using an Action delegate requires that you have defined a method that contains the code that you want

                substantial number of methods. This makes maintenance more difficult. A more common approach is to use 
                an anonymous method. An anonymous method is a method without a name, and you provide the code for an 
                anonymous method inline, at the point you need to it. You can use the delegate keyword to convert an 
                anonymous method into a delegate.

                A lambda expression is a shorthand syntax that provides a simple and concise way to define anonymous 
                delegates. When you create a Task instance, you can use a lambda expression to define the delegate that 
                you want to associate with your task. 

                If you want your delegate to invoke a named method or a single line of code, you use can use a lambda 
                expression. A lambda expression provides a shorthand notation for defining a delegate that can take 
                parameters and return a result. It has the following form: 

                    (input parameters) => expression 

                In this case: 

                    • The lambda operator, =>, is read as “goes to.” 
                    • The left side of the lambda operator includes any variables that you want to pass to the 
                      expression. If you do not require any inputs—for example, if you are invoking a method that takes 
                      no parameters—you include empty parentheses () on the left side of the lambda operator. 

                The right side of the lambda operator includes the expression you want to evaluate. This could be a 
                comparison of the input parameters—for example, the expression (x, y) => x == y will return true if x 
                is equal to y; otherwise, it will return false. Alternatively, you can call a method on the right side 
                of the lambda operator.

                A lambda expression can be a simple expression or function call, as the previous example shows, or it 
                can reference a more substantial block of code. To do this, specify the code in curly braces (like the 
                body of a method) on the right side of the lambda operator: 

                    (input parameters) => { Visual C# statements; } 

                As your delegates become more complex, lambda expressions offer a far more concise and easily 
                understood way to express anonymous delegates and anonymous methods. As such, lambda expressions are 
                the recommended approach when you work with tasks.

        Tasks are often used to perform long-running operations without blocking the UI thread, because of their 
        asynchronous nature. In some cases, you will want to give your users the opportunity to cancel a task if they 
        are tired of waiting. However, it would be dangerous to simply abort the task on demand, because this could 
        leave your application data in an unknown state. Instead, the Task Parallel Library uses cancellation tokens to 
        support a cooperative cancellation model. At a high level, the cancellation process works as follows: 

            1. When you create a task, you also create a cancellation token.
            2. You pass the cancellation token as an argument to your delegate method.
            3. On the thread that created the task, you request cancellation by calling the Cancel method on the 
              cancellation token source. 
            4. In your task method, you can check the status of the cancellation token at any point. If the instigator 
              has requested that the task be cancelled, you can terminate your task logic gracefully, possibly rolling 
              back any changes resulting from the work that the task has performed. 

        Typically, you would check whether the cancellation token has been set to canceled at one or more convenient 
        points in your task logic. For example, if your task logic iterates over a collection, you might check for 
        cancellation after each iteration.

                status is set to RanToCompletion. In other words, the task has no way of knowing why the method 
                returned—it may have returned in response to a cancellation request, or it may simply have completed

        Sometimes it is useful to sequence tasks. For example, you might require that if a task completes successfully, 
        another task is run, or if the task fails, a different task is run that possibly needs to perform some kind of 
        recovery process. A task that runs only when a previous task finishes is called a continuation. This approach

        nature. The parent task (the task that spawned the new or nested tasks) can wait for the nested tasks to 
        complete before it finishes itself, or it can return and let the child tasks continue running asynchronously. 
        
        Tasks that cause the parent task to wait are called child tasks.
