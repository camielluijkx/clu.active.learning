        The .Net framework consists of several components, built one upon the other.

        The first is the CLR. This is the engine that envelops and runs all .Net applications. 
         
        The CLR is responsible for - among other things: the execution of .Net code, Memory 
        management and garbage collection for the application, exception handling, etc. 

        Above the CLR is the Base Class Library (BCL), that includes all the built-in types in the 
        .Net Framework. 

        Above that are the specific implementation of the different languages .Net supports.
